# Typer

## What is this?

A simple test typing game, where you're given a block of text and you try to
write it as fast as possible. Similar to The Typing Cat and Monkeytype.

Useful for learning touch typing to type faster and for trying out your new keyboard.

## Modes

1. **No wrong characters displayed.** With this mode enabled, if the user inputs
   undesired characters, those characters won't show up on the text box. Instead only correct characters are displayed.
2. **Wrong characters are displayed, but are marked with red text.** If the
   user inputs a character that is differnt from the expected character on the
   text box, then that incorrect character will be displayed with red text. The
   user can delete that character. (Note: this mode is planned and not available yet.)
